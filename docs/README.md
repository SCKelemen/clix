## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is designed to be read sequentially. Each chapter builds on the previous ones:

- **Start with Commands** to understand the basic structure
- **Progress through Arguments and Flags** to handle user input
- **Learn about Configuration** to make your CLI configurable
- **Explore Prompts** starting with simple text, then validation, then advanced features
- **Discover Surveys** to create complex interactive flows
- **Understand Extensions** to customize and extend CLIX

## Examples

Each section includes working code examples that you can copy and run. Examples are designed to be:
- **Self-contained** - Run them independently
- **Progressive** - Each builds on previous concepts
- **Practical** - Show real-world usage patterns

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Basic understanding of Go programming
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

Let's get started with [Commands](1_commands.md)!
